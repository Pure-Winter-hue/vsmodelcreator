This is a version of VSMC with changes divergent of the main branch, that may or may not ever make it to the main VSMC. While I use my main branch for bug fixes for the main VSMC, I use this branch to add new features! :)

This version of VSMC has these additions:
-Multiselect (click an element in the hierchy then hold shift, and click more of them.) <- precursor to mutli part editting without needing to parent.
-Mirror Button (mirrors whatever is multi selected, or everything under the thing you have selected i.e. the top parent and all its children.) Neatly stacks UV's.
-UV Flip buttons for left right/up.
